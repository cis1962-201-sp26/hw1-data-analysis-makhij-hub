# Homework 1: Data Analysis Reflection

## How many hours did you spend working on this homework?
    2-3. Mostly of that time was spent familiarizing myself with the language and papaparse

## What challenges/roadblocks did you face during this homework?
    This is my first time using Javascript, it took me a bit to figure out how to work with the dictionary objects and the truthiness/falsinees, as well as the dynamic names for variables. All of these were realtively new topics for me, so it took me a bit to get used to. 

## Did you use AI/LLM tools for this assignment? If so, please provide a transcript or document your usage extensively below. If you did use AI, please explain why you decided to use AI for the task you used it for.

I had the built in VS code autofill on when I started doing the project. Eventually I turned it off because I found it annoying, and it kept recommending me code that was not intuitive and not the way that I wanted to/knew how to solve the problems.
